# Secret Woods Snorlax

Instead of a hollow log blocking your path into the Secret Woods, there's a
big, lazy creature sleeping there. It's Snorlax, the OG champion of sleeping in
inconvenient locations. How will you get past him?

(Do not use your axe. That is rude, and will not work.)

(Do not use a chair, either. I'll know.)

After you interact with him, the villagers will start giving you hints. These
clues should help you figure out how to trigger the event you need to get the
big oaf to move. You can try to work it out on your own (the requirements are
not very steep), or you can read these spoiler blocks:

Starting from the next day after interacting with Snorlax:
  
* Days 1&ndash;3: Shane, Abigail, Linus
* Days 4&ndash;6: Evelyn, Emily, Leah
* Days 7&ndash;9: Demetrius, Penny, Lewis
</details>

**The solution**
<details><summary>Spoiler</summary>
Earn a total of 20,000g and reach 2 hearts with the Wizard. Then enter his tower.

Only the main player can trigger the event (no farmhands).

After you've moved Snorlax, he'll stick around. He'll just be a few tiles over,
safely out of the way, so you can continue to hang out with him.

## Requirements

You will need the following dependencies:

* SMAPI
* Json Assets
* SpaceCore

## Compatibility

Yes: Stardew Valley Expanded (now with fixed plot event!)

Yes: Stardew Valley Reimagined 3

Yes: Lunna Astray in Stardew Valley (no longer blocks entrance after moving)

Dubious: mods that alter the Secret Woods entrance

Most other things should be fine. This mod doesn't do a lot.

## Old Save Files

If you've already destroyed the log obstacle in your current save file, don't
worry! Snorlax will still be here for you. He'll simply be in the moved
position to start, ready to be your friend. No one will give you hints, since
they aren't needed. You will still be able to trigger the event (the dialogue
will change slightly).

Similarly, it should be safe to delete this mod at any point, although there is
a Json Assets item in it, so take your usual precautions to avoid a shuffle.
